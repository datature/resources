This folder contains sample scripts for one-shot learning.

## One-Shot Learning

One-shot learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on a single example of a class. This is useful for applications where the number of training examples is limited, such as in medical imaging. We provide two sample scripts for one-shot learning:

- [Decoupled Faster R-CNN for Few-Shot Object Detection (DeFRCN)](one-shot-learning/defrcn_demo.ipynb)
- [One-Stage One-Shot Object Detection by Matching Anchor Features (OS2D)](one-shot-learning/os2d_demo.ipynb)

## Getting Started

To run the juptyer notebooks, simply clone this repository and open the notebooks in your local environment. The notebooks can be run on Google Colab as well.
