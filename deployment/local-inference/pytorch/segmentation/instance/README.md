# Datature PyTorch Instance Segmentation Model Guide

Instance segmentation for PyTorch models is still under development and is currently not supported on Nexus. Please export your instance segmentation model as another format such as [Tensorflow](../../../tensorflow/segmentation/instance/), [TFLite](../../../tflite/segmentation/instance/), or [ONNX](../../../onnx/segmentation/instance/), and refer to their respective guides.
